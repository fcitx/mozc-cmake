mozc cmake
================
This is a project that intend to build mozc with cmake.

The motivation is to allow easier build for mozc & fcitx on non-Linux platforms.

It does not strictly follow mozc upstream and only tracks a specific commit of https://github.com/fcitx/mozc.

Only oss build is planned to be supported.
